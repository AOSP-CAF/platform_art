This test checks call sites and constant method handles in DEX files used
by invoke-custom.

It is derived from a dx test (dalvik/dx/tests/135-invoke-custom) which
generates the invoke-custom using ASM to generate class files. The
test here differs as it not include an instance a constant method
handle with a constructor kind (see b/62774190).
